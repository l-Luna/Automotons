### Automotons
Small robots that run instructions (in the form of items called modules), and carry heads that provide functionality.

Currently, ten heads and nineteen modules exist, with more to be added in the future.

Automotons should be free of major bugs, but you may still find bugs hiding about. Testing (and PRs!) are appreciated.

This mod runs on *Fabric*, and requires Fabric API. This also depends on, and includes, Patchouli.
